# store
The purpose of this repository is to consolidate my knowledge of architectures, frameworks, and standards.

My plan is to develop a store with all the basic features that a store should have, like searching for products, filters, adding to the cart and making the purchase.

DDD will guide the design of the architecture, and at this very initial point, my dev stack will be:

* Asp.net Core
* Restful Web API
* React as the SGP
* Elasticsearch 

My initial goal is: Create a Store App using DDD with the related dev stack.

Everything can change, and I will make this repo as a big dev diary, and today (04/20/2018) I do not know how it will end but will be very funny.
